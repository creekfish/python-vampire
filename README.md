Python port of classic MS-DOS Vampire's Castle text adventure game

The original game "Vampire's Castle" was written in BASIC for MSDOS, and I first played it in the early 1980's on a Commodore Vic20 computer. A thread discussing this obscure little game can still be found here: https://www.dosgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11302. The original BASIC code can be found here: http://www.dosgames.com/vampire.zip

As a project when I was first learning the Java language (on the job in a big hurry!) I created a version of the game in Java, much refactored and cleaner than the orinal BASIC program, tho sadly lacking its nostalgic charm.

Later I created this Python port of the old game while I was teaching my daughter some Python programming.

OK, enough history.  So how can you play this fantastic little text adventure you ask?

1. Download/clone it from github: git@github.com:creekfish/python-vampire.git
2. 

Hopefully you can avoid becoming the vampire's lunch... Enjoy!
